# Coco3

Coco3 is a shell written in Go, providing Vim-like key mappings and painless
syntax.

## Install

To install, use `go get`:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/elpinal/coco3
```

-u flag stands for "update".

## Motivation

Most shells have too complicated syntax. Some shells have an insufficient
editing facility. These facts lead to develop Coco3 shell.
